Probably the most needed service by our specific school is comment translation. We have to pay people to translate our freeform comments for us. It is critical that we use freeform comments, rather than ""canned comments"", (which I know can be translated automatically) so we can address the specific successes and short-comings of each student, as well as reference data and what it means. This cannot be done with ""canned"" comments. If the ability to translate the comments automatically were available, this would be BEYOND helpful. Even if the translation were 80% accurate, our translators could at least proofread, rather than translate the whole thing. Generally, 60%-70% of the comments need to be translated by a Spanish-Speaker at our school. ",In-app
