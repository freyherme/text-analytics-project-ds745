The amount of steps and how you have to create a item to attach it to test are majorly time consuming. With computing technology being what it is testing software should be simple, almost like dragging in dropping question along with the images all at the same time.  Uploading a document and the software creating the test does not seem so far fetched. I put a standard style test in a it took hour and half to simply input the test, and I had zero complications. I can not click any faster, by the end I had cramps in my fingers and wasted so much time putting in one of my 10 unit tests.

user-ccresa.live-889,2018-10-04 06:16:36,"I think illuminate adds unnecessary and unimportant work to my day.  Examples are having to enter ongoing information for students who are no longer on my direct service caseload, but linger on my illuminate caseload for a month or more.  If I don't enter information for these students, the next month they are flagged as overdue.  Another example is the past August, we started school the last week of August, but the majority of my students were not provided service that month, again I had to enter information for each student, forty-something, indicating that service was not provided.  Also, being unable to add information to an IEP until each section is filled is very inconvenient.  I perceive these examples as unproductive use of my time for the sake of a technological program, that further minimizes my ability to provide service to students. Thanks for allowing my input.

I do attendance I do not need to know about assessments or the counselors stuff.  It is like some badge of honor to get through dealing with this program. You need to know some secret code to be able to create a report. Standard types of report could be created with the ability to slightly deviate for individual needs. I am unable to help teachers or student groups on campus as I am unable to figure out how to create a simple report like a list of student birthdays by Month and day.  Sorry I don't have any more time to tell you more as I have to go find a list of the attendance letters that were sent to individual students. Go Me!!",0,musd.dna::9999999-Morongo USD

There are some innovative aspects to it; the dashboard and the ability to customize what widgets are available on my screen is nice. But there are some aspects of Illuminate that are a nuisance. For example, when resetting my seating chairs I may have to jump back and forth from Arrange Students to View Seating Charts (to print). When I transition from one view to the next, the system automatically brings me back to the first class in my day. Why not keep me in the class I'm working with? Or better yet, why not give me the option of printing from the Arrange Students view so I don't have to switch views at all? There are a lot of those little inconveniences making Illuminate less efficient.",5,musd.dna::9999999-Morongo USD

It is NOT intuitive. Even with the latest upgrades to the menu, it still is not user friendly.
The size of the font on printed reports, including printed seating charts, is minuscule, and not change-able.
My district has been working to get AVID standards loaded in to Illuminate, as our school is 100% standards based instruction, but for some reason, that's no happening. We've been asking for it for 3 years. And, no, all of the other standards do not cover all of the AVID standards. 
When entering grades, if i accidentally type in the wrong box, or delete what was in a box, there is no way to recover what was originally there. If my records are 100% electronic, the data may be lost.
When gradebooks are set on ""auto update"", there should be a way to also ""force"" an update. Sometimes, auto doesn't work and I lose data.

It seems as though most everything I use takes 5 more clicks than it should to get where I need to go. I mean, why should I have to be in a separate screen to edit a seating chart then move to a different screen to print the seating chart? Why can't I adjust the print size of a progress report? The words are so small they are very difficult to read. This seems like a no-brainer that teachers should be able to adjust the print size of a report.

Help is hard to get and even after many requests for changes to functions, problems are not solved. For example, I have requested several times, over several years, that Illuminate update scores (total scores, as in grades) for assignments as soon as entered, instead of waiting for the due date of the assignment to show the new total for a student.  Another example: several times I have tried to link tests to gradebook and have gotten error messages. Tests are prepared and published, assignment created as an ""assessment"", but linking to gradebook does not work.  I have to enter those scores manually.

This is disruptive because we get new teachers every year.  It doesn't seem like teachers were consulted in creating this program. ",2,berkeley.dna::9999999-Berkeley Unified School District

Not intuitive, it takes a long time for things to load that should be simple/quick, many issues. Things that I would like for easy access as a teacher are not easily accessible. Frustrating, tiny print, and not linked to SEIS. This linkage would really help school districts, as all school districts have students with IEP's. Please confer with actual teachers moving forward, and find a way to connect with SEIS before assuming we will continue to use your very expensive system/database.

user-eup.ise-100000864,2018-10-04 08:42:17,"It is NOT user friendly and when issues are brought up to Customer Support, they are rearely listened to.  For example, when this program was first put inplace at our school, we asked for the side bar with names to be locked and for the top row where the assignments are listed to be locked inplace so that when we scroll, the names are always visible as well as the assignment.  It has not happened and that request was made  the first year we got the program so at least 4 years ago.  This year, suddenly we cananot use commas in listing an assigment.  WHAT?  So I can't call an assignment Ch. 6, Sec. 1 - Sec. 3.  Also, posting grades is not user friendly especially at the end of the semester when we need to post Semester Exam, Quarter 2, and the S1 Final grade.  There should be one page to post all these grades for a class at one time.  I cannot recommend this program at all to others.  From the administrator standpoint, they say it is ok.  However, teachers use it all day long:(  ",0,eup.ise::17000-Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District (District)

I would recommend taking away the pictures of the icons, just words are good enough so we don't need to scroll up and down that much. And is it possible to customize the scroll bar on the left? so each user can move the most frequently used one on the top of the list. Also, Illuminate does not logout all the windows when a user uses multiple windows and logout one window. Illuminate does not show an error message or the login screen.  The user has the impression that Illuminate is slow in processing instead of he has logged out. I remember it showed the login screen before the summer.

For example, if I go to pull down bar {Select Section} to select Period 5, I should be able to see a previous class I have missed in red font to quickly see what I have missed.  I should not have to leave the screen I am on and click on the dashboard to check for a red X.  It should easily shown in the font color of each class in that pull down bar where I regularly go to take attendance.

I am also frustrated that to give the above feedback has been very difficult to get to Illuminate.  I called customer support and was given an area of which to submit my suggestions.  An area where teachers ""read"" through other comments and vote.  I don't know one teacher on my campus who spends the time going to the Illuminate feedback area to submit feedback let alone read others comments and vote on them.

This was never an issue with all of our other programs. In previous programs we have used, made it easy to make personalized reports, pulling info from the program, however this program makes it so difficult that only the IT department is able to do it & even then it is usually lacking quite a lot . Our needs change daily for what is needed in reports & this simply does not cut it at all. There are many other issues but this program makes my work day almost double in the workload & time needed & i do not want to waste anymore on this as i feel it will do no good anyways.

1.  When live proctoring a test, I wish we could sort by class so all the classes I teach are not displayed at one time.
2.  When a new 9 weeks happens, I wish there was not a delay in updating rosters.  It makes it very inconvenient when administering a 2 day test that happens to fall in that time period.",5,dcboe.live::9999999-Decatur County

There are many examples but the most recent is that if I create an item with a table that has more than one blank, I have to hand score it because your system only allows for one.  I can't create an item with multiple categories, multiple choices, etc.  It just isn't a great tool for teachers to use and the K-1 features could use a lesson or two from ESGI.  It's great for admin and data highways but that doesn't help your typical classroom teacher.",6,washington.live::9999999-Washington Unified School District

user-paramount.live-3748,2018-10-04 14:50:26,"this program is not user friendly. There are too many screens and options all at once. It is almost impossible to find what you need to be able to get the data you need or input your data to the system. the training we have been given is not specific to grades and so multiple options are thrown out at a ridiculous pace to try to cover needs of multiple grade users. The computers used for the training have access to windows and screens the trainees do not have with interfaces that look different. And finally, the teachers don't use the program every day, so it is hard to remember how to do things when there is so much time between uses.

We spend so much extra time doing quizzes on paper and then putting them into the computer so we can have a hard copy because there is no way to print....then I have to grade paper and electronic copies separately. ,0,dpsk12.live::9999999-DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS

It is definitely getting more complicated and time consuming to use even when you do know exactly where to click to do something.  Several of the teachers at my work site flat out refuse to use it.  Instead they've found it easier to download their own scanning apps for their cell phones.  

When a $5 app on a cell phone is a better fit for teachers than whatever it is the district pays for illuminate, you know you're doing something wrong with all the resources you've put into your user interface ""upgrades"".

Maybe Illuminate has some value to administrators managing student information, but I haven't been trained in any of that.  

As a test scanning program, I rate it irritating but usable.
For test creation and data analysis, maybe it can do stuff, but is it worth the effort to figure out.  No one I know thinks so.",2,alhambra.live::9999999-Alhambra Unified School District

I can't make simple fixes, and have it stay. It is too vast and not organized well. It's one more thing I have to do on top of the 700 other things I have to do. It would be nice if I didn't have to hand enter the scores from her into power pro. I have to enter the scores from NWEA to here. I need a full time secretary to keep up with all the hand entering of data in multiple places. Thank you for asking.

I am a user who does not create assessments, but I look for data on state and district assessments. I try to create a roster, and try to look for information (repeatedly) on a set of students, and I have found this difficult to set up, and non-intuitive. I do not find the help I'm looking for in the search or ""?"" resources. I am frustrated with Illuminate; I usually spend a lot of time looking for what I need, or trying to create what I need, and often don't find it.  I would suggest a simplified and more user friendly help or online manual, and interfaces that help various types and levels of users.

user-centinela.dna-299,2018-10-08 07:14:44,"Generally, the system works pretty well, but there are a few weaknesses and annoyances:
1)  I've spent years (100's of man-hours, easily) developing my own test bank in Exam View (version 4 or 6 . . . not sure which), and Illuminate doesn't support importing Exam View bnk files.  
2)  I can't have Illuminate ignore erased marks.  When a kid changes his mind on a question and erases the old answer, the scanning software treats the MUCH fainter mark as part of a two-bubble response.  I need a settings option to ignore 2nd bubbles if they're below a certain relative faintness threshold.
3)  I never use the default webcam on my laptop, yet Illuminate always makes me wait for it to load in during scanning before I can switch to my USB document camera (an iPEVO VZ-R).  I'd like to set my iPEVO as my default camera so I don't have to go through that extra step.",7,centinela.dna::9999999-Centinela Valley Union High School District

Training is anemic and never addresses the actual needs...HOW TO EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATE THIS FRUSTRATING PROGRAM. School city was better. Edusoft was even better. ",0,duarte.live::9999999-Duarte Unified School District

Does not give pertinent reports regarding students with moderate/severe disabilities for BASICS 3 Benchmarks.
Very difficult to use because the categories for BASICS 3 Benchmarks are coded by abbreviated letters instead of full labels. Teachers have to use guide sheet to fill out areas of assessment. Progress report does not give overall performance level (SPL 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for each area skill and does not provide for an overall SPL average level for the domain as a whole.
